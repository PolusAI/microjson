# Roadmap

Below is a high-level roadmap for the development of MicroJSON. The roadmap is divided into four phases, each focusing on different aspects of the project. The goal is to gradually expand the capabilities of MicroJSON, engage with the community, and establish a sustainable development model. The below roadmap is subject to change based on feedback and evolving requirements.

## Phase 1: Consolidation and Documentation

1. **Refinement of Core Model**:
    * Finalize and stabilize the current MicroJSON core model.
    * Update according to feedback from key stakeholders and users.
    * Publish updated documentation and specifications.
    * Implement hierarchical references.

2. **Initial Community Engagement**:
    * Reach out to further potential users and stakeholders to gather feedback and requirements.
    * Establish a communication channel for ongoing discussions and updates, using GitHub issues.

## Phase 2: Expanded Features and Extensions

1. **Harmonization with GeoJSON Pydantic**:
    * Investigate potential compatibility and dependency with GeoJSON Pydantic.

2. **Harmonization with OME Model**:
    * Harmonize MicroJSON with the OME model for coordinate systems and metadata.

3. **TypeScript and Java reference implementations**:
    * Develop reference implementations in TypeScript and Java to demonstrate the use of MicroJSON in different programming languages.
    * Provide tools and libraries for working with MicroJSON data in these languages.

4. **Tiling with TileJSON and binary formats**:
    * Create a use case with TileJSON, including MicroJSON for tiling.
    * Implement vector tile binary format tooling for exporting to and from MicroJSON.

## Phase 3: 3D and Multidimensional Data

1. **2.5D - 2D slices with tiling to build 3D**:
    * Explore the representation of 3D and multidimensional data in MicroJSON.
    * Start with 3D geometries that consist of multiple 2D slices, with tiling support.
2. **General 3D Data Model**:
    * Define a general 3D data mesh model that can represent complex 3D structures.
    * Investigate tilings for scalable 3D data representation.

## Phase 4: Adoptopm amd long-term sustainability

1. **Case Studies and How-To Guides**:
    * Document and publish case studies demonstrating the use of MicroJSON in key applications.
    * Encourage the development of real-world applications utilizing MicroJSON by providing how-to guides and tutorials.

2. **Establish Governance and Standards Process**:
    * Set up a governance model for the ongoing development and maintenance of MicroJSON.
    * Establish a process for standardizing and accepting new features or extensions.
    * Set up user meetings with regular intervals to gather feedback and discuss future directions, based on technological advancements and user feedback.
