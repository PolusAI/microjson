# Integration of TileJSON with MicroJSON
## Purpose
This specification outlines how to use TileJSON to integrate tiled MicroJSON data. It provides examples of how TileJSON can be used to specify the tiling scheme and zoom levels for MicroJSON data. It is based on the [TileJSON 3.0.0 specification](https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec/blob/master/3.0.0/README.md), but extends it by recommending additional properties include the integration of MicroJSON data and fit purposes of microscopy data visualization. The recommendations provided here are not intrinsic to the original TileJSON specification but have been tailored to suit the needs of microscopy data visualization and integration with MicroJSON. However, all suggestions are designed to maintain compatibility with the original TileJSON specification.

## Background of TileJSON

[TileJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec/) is a widely-used format in mapping applications for specifying tilesets. Developed to streamline the integration of different map layers, TileJSON is essential for ensuring consistency across mapping platforms. It describes tilesets through a JSON object, detailing properties like tile URLs, zoom levels, and spatial coverage.


## TileJSON for MicroJSON Object Structure

- **`tilejson`:** Specifies the version of the TileJSON spec being used. Required for all TileJSON objects.
- **`name`:** The name of the tileset. Optional but recommended.
- **`description`:** Provide a brief description of the tileset. Optional but recommended.
- **`version`:** The version of the tileset. Optional but recommended.
- **`attribution`:** A link to the data source or other attribution information, e.g. organisational origin. Optional but recommended.
- **`tiles`:** Required. The URL pattern for accessing the vector tiles. The  `urlbase/{zlvl}/{t}/{c}/{z}/{x}/{y}` is the recommended default naming pattern for the tiles, in this order, where `urlbase` is the base URL (e.g. `http://example.com/tiles`), `{zlvl}` is the zoom level, `{t}` is the tileset timestamp, `{c}` is the channel, `{z}` is the z coordinate, and `{x}` and `{y}` are the x and y coordinates, respectively. 
- **`minzoom` and `maxzoom`:** Defines the range of zoom levels for which the tiles are available. 
- **`bounds`:** Optional. Specifies the geometrical bounds included in the tileset. Specified as an array of minimum four numbers in the order `[minX, minY, maxX, maxY]`, but may include up to a further six numbers for a total of ten, `[minT, minC, minZ, minX, minY, maxT, maxC, maxZ, maxX, maxY]`, where `minT` is the minimum tileset timestamp, `minC` is the minimum channel, `minZ` is the minimum z coordinate, `minX` and `minY` are the minimum x and y coordinates, `maxT` is the maximum tileset timestamp, `maxC` is the maximum channel, `maxZ` is the maximum z coordinate, and `maxX` and `maxY` are the maximum x and y coordinates.
- **`center`:** Optional. Indicates the center and suggested default view of the tileset. Minimum of three numbers in the order `[x, y, zoom]`, but may include up to a further three numbers for a total of six, `[t,c,z,x,y,zoom]`, where `t` is the tileset timestamp, `c` is the channel, `z` is the z coordinate, `x` and `y` are the x and y coordinates, and `zoom` is the zoom level. Zoom level should be last.
- **`vector_layers`:**  Required. Describes each layer within the vector tiles, and has the following structure:

  - **`id`:** Required. A unique identifier for the layer. Required for each layer.
  - **`fields`:** Required. A list of fields (attributes) and their data types. For MicroJSON, this can either be an empty list, or any combination of `string`, `numerical`, and `multiNumeric`, attributes with their sub-attributes, as described in the MicroJSON specification. Required for each layer.
  - **`description`:** Optional. A brief description of the layer.
  - **`minzoom` and `maxzoom`:** Optional. The range of zoom levels at which the layer is visible.
- **`fillzoom`:** Optional. An integer specifying the zoom level from which to generate overzoomed tiles.
- **`legend`:** Optional. Contains a legend to be displayed with the tileset.

The following fields of TileJSON may be used if the use case requires it, and are included here for completeness:

- **`scheme`:** The tiling scheme of the tileset.
- **`grids`:** The URL pattern for accessing grid data.
- **`data`:** Optional. The URL pattern for accessing data. Used for GeoJSON originally, which in this specification is replaced by MicroJSON and used in the `tiles` field.
- **`template`:** Optional. Contains a mustache template to be used to format data from grids for interaction.

## TileJSON for MicroJSON example with Vector Layers
The below example illustrates a TileJSON for a MicroJSON tileset multiple layers of detail. The tileset has a single vector layer, `image_layer` id of `vector_layers`, which contains a single vector layer describing images. The `fields` property of the this layer specifies the attributes of the layer, including the data types of the attributes. The `tiles` property specifies the URL pattern for accessing the vector tiles, which in this case is a 2D data set (no channels, time or z-axis) with zoom level. The `fillzoom` property specifies the zoom level from which to generate overzoomed tiles, which in this case starts at level 3, after the last specified layer.

This file is located in the `examples/tiles` directory of the repository, and is named `tiled_example.json`. It has a corresponding MicroJSON file for each tile, located in the `examples/tiles/tiled_example` directory of the repository. The MicroJSON files are organized according to the tiling scheme, with the directory structure `zlvl/x/y.json` where `zlvl` is the zoom level, `x` is the x coordinate, and `y` is the y coordinate. The MicroJSON files contain the MicroJSON objects for the corresponding tiles, and are named according to the tiling scheme. For example, the MicroJSON object for the tile at zoom level 1, tile at (0,1) in the tiling scheme is located at `examples/tiles/tiled_example/1/0/1.json`. Examples for MicroJSON objects at zoom levels 0, 1, and 2 are provided below.

```json
{
    {
    "tilejson": "3.0.0",
    "name": "2D Data Example",
    "description": "A tileset showing 2D data with multiple layers of detail.",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "attribution": "<a href='http://example.com'>Example</a>",
    "tiles": [
        "http://example.com/tiled_example/{zlvl}/{x}/{y}.json"
    ],
    "minzoom": 0,
    "maxzoom": 10,
    "bounds": [0, 0, 24000, 24000],
    "center": [12000, 12000, 0],
    "vector_layers": [
        {
            "id": "Tile_layer",
            "description": "Tile layer",
            "minzoom": 0,
            "maxzoom": 10,
            "fields": {
              "plate": "String",
              "image": "String",
              "label": "Number",
              "channel": "Number"
            }
        }
    ],
    "fillzoom": 3
}
```

## Tiled binary TileJSON
Tiles may be encoded in a binary protobuf format as well. Below follows a similar example to the one above, but with binary tiles. The `tiles` property specifies the URL pattern for accessing the binary tiles, which in this case is a 2D data set (no channels, time or z-axis) with zoom level. The `fillzoom` property specifies the zoom level from which to generate overzoomed tiles, which in this case starts at level 3, after the last specified layer.

```json
{
    {
    "tilejson": "3.0.0",
    "name": "2D Data Example",
    "description": "A tileset showing 2D data with multiple layers of detail.",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "attribution": "<a href='http://example.com'>Example</a>",
    "tiles": [
        "http://example.com/tiled_example/{zlvl}/{x}/{y}.pbf"
    ],
    "minzoom": 0,
    "maxzoom": 10,
    "bounds": [0, 0, 24000, 24000],
    "center": [12000, 12000, 0],
    "vector_layers": [
        {
            "id": "tile_layer",
            "description": "Tile layer",
            "minzoom": 0,
            "maxzoom": 10,
            "fields": {
              "plate": "String",
              "image": "String",
              "label": "Number",
              "channel": "Number"
            }
        }
    ],
    "fillzoom": 3
}
```

## Tiled binary example
The examples folder contains an example of how to generate binary tiles from one large MicroJSON file. It uses a helper module that generates a large random polygon grid, as could be expected in an imaging setting, using typical imaging coordinates. It is also included below for reference.
