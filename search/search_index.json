The <code>tiles</code> property specifies the URL pattern for accessing the vector tiles, which in this case is a 2D data set (no channels, time or z-axis) with zoom level.</p> <p>This file is located in the <code>examples/tiles</code> directory of the repository, and is named <code>tiled_example.json</code>. It has a corresponding MicroJSON file for each tile, located in the <code>examples/tiles/tiled_example</code> directory of the repository. The MicroJSON files are organized according to the tiling scheme, with the directory structure <code>zlvl/x/y.json</code> where <code>zlvl</code> is the zoom level, <code>x</code> is the x coordinate, and <code>y</code> is the y coordinate. The MicroJSON files contain the MicroJSON objects for the corresponding tiles, and are named according to the tiling scheme. For example, the MicroJSON object for the tile at zoom level 1, tile at (0,1) in the tiling scheme is located at <code>examples/tiles/tiled_example/1/0/1.json</code>.
