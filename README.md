# MicroJSON

MicroJSON is a JSON-based format inspired by [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org), designed to encode a variety of data structures related to microscopy images. It can handle representations of reference points, regions of interest, and other annotations, making it an ideal solution for conveying complex microscopy data in a straightforward, easy-to-use format.

## Features

MicroJSON offers a range of features designed to meet the needs of microscopy data representation:

- **Flexible Data Structures:** MicroJSON can represent diverse data structures, including geometries (such as points, multipoints, linestrings, polygons), features (individual entities with specific properties), feature collections (groups of features), and coordinate systems.

- **Standardized Format:** MicroJSON uses the widely adopted JSON format, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of programming languages and tools.

- **Extensibility:** MicroJSON can handle additional properties associated with specific features, such as metadata relating to microscopy images.

## Usage

MicroJSON can be used with any application or tool that can process JSON data. Due to its design, it is particularly suited to applications related to the analysis, visualization, and manipulation of microscopy images.

## Examples

Refer to the examples foler to see samples of MicroJSON files as well as a simple parsing example, or the [example in the documentation](docs/example.md)

## Specification

For more detailed information about the MicroJSON structure and its components, please refer to the [Specification](docs/index.md) file.
